Edo period (1600-1868) woodblock prints of famous places, called meisho-e, often contained seasonal indicators including an array of flowers and trees associated with particular times of year. Seen below clouds and cloud-like profusions of springtime sakura blossoms, this view by Hiroshige II (pupil and adopted son of the celebrated Andō Hiroshige) depicts the Hase-dera or Hase Temple, one of the most renowned pilgrimage sites in Japan mentioned in literary works going back to the Heian Period (794-1185).
